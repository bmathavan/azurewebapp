Who has inspired you most
=========================
The missing place of Dr. Kalam can never be filled but his inspiring words will forever be with us and inspire us to do more. RIP Missile Man. You will be missed.

My most inspired role model is a well known person for indians, He is a great Indian Scientist, 

He is most popular President, and a very good mentor - yes he is Dr APJ Abdul Kalam.

Dr APJ Abdul Kalam is remembered for his contributions to the country in many roles.

Popularly remembered as 'People's President' and 'Missile Man', Dr Kalam's demise on July 27, 2015 left the nation in shock and pain.

The humble president was a great scientist, an inspiring leader, and above anything else, he was a simple and a very strong human being. His speeches and interactions, particularly with students, inspired millions. His quotes and lectures motivated, encouraged and inspired the youth to strive to fulfill their dreams. And by sharing his experiences with young minds, he would ignite the wings of fire among them to work hard and achieve their dreams.

Dr. Kalam’s infectious personality had not just inspired Indians but also people across the globe.
When Dr. Kalam first moved to Rashtrapati Bhawan, he asked all luxurious rooms to be locked up as he didn’t want to use them.


The missing place of Dr. Kalam can never be filled but his inspiring words will forever be with us and inspire us to do more. RIP Missile Man. You will be missed.
