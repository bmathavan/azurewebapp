Advantages and Disadvantages of the Internet:
Internet has become a breath of people in last few years.

Rather than entertainment purpose, its highly beneficial for education too.

The Good & Bad uses of computers...
It was a time where computers are only used as calculators. Nowadays it has been essential part of everyone’s life. Computers are user friendly & with that we can learn the things which we wish to know and computes play a vital role in all technologies globally. All the billing systems and payments are computerized to avoid manual effort and time. At the same time we have some negative impressions too on computes in which we always tie up and spend more time rather than friends, relatives, and family members. It reduces our interaction with others so we obviously lose something and we spend our most of time with machine which is really bad.

Both City and Village have their own advantages and disadvantages. In City, we can explore many things. With lots of opportunities we can explore ourselves too.

City provides us wide exposure in education as well as in life style. Here everyone has their own way of living. In cities we will be having plenty of places for entertainment.
