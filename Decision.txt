Toughest decision of my life :  Toughest decision of my life is to choose the kind of work that I wanted to do. I like the job I am doing. Infact I love it more than others. There is a certain amount of responsibility to each of us in our food product based project. What we individuals deliver, gets collected as a whole and brings revenue to the project. To know that I am part of a bigger chain and if I do not deliver my work, somewhere at other part of the world, the end product becomes a piece of lesser quality. I like this part of the work where I am part of the bigger circle of events.

There are 2 toughest decisions that I ever made in my life.

The first one is about to choose my career. I want to be an engineer but my parents planned for me something else because of financial problems. At that time this decision was toughest for me to choose parents planned career path or my own. But I go against to my parents path and tried my best to get the scholarship from college, which I also did giving my best performance.

Second decision that I have taken is to choose between job and higher studies. In this I have chosen to do job only. I have to learn more within the job and get an experience. I also want to emphasize my skills and gain more knowledge. I like the job I am doing. Infact I love it more than others. There is a certain amount of responsibility to each of us in our product based project. To know that I am part of a bigger chain and if I do not deliver my work, somewhere at other part of the world, the end product becomes a piece of lesser quality.I like this part of the work where I am part of the bigger circle of events.
