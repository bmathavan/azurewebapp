• Management agrees to work with employees to develop more schedule options. These will include the 40-hour, 4-day work week. Job sharing might also be possible if two employees can work out a weekly schedule between them.

Layoffs May Be Looming!
*********************** 

Are you feeling worried? Anxious? Even overwhelmed? Are you concerned that you may be laid off? What if the rumors about a takeover are true?

Well your worries may be justified. Statistics show that even well-trained, senior workers can’t count on guaranteed employment these days. The corporate world is volatile- even cut-throat. Downsizing is rampant. Says Mitch Jones, head of Future Alternatives, inc., “Workforces everywhere are being reduced. Even skilled employees run the risk of losing their jobs, and possible their careers, if they are not flexible.”

Could this happen to you? If you are over 30, you are a prime target for being laid off. If you haven’t been keeping your skills current, you also could be in serious danger.

1. According to this article, employees should  _____________.
A. be cut-throat on the job.
B. be flexible in job choices.
C. cash their paychecks.
D. pursue one career option


2. In this article, the word this refers to ________ .


A. not being flexible at work
B. Workers losing their jobs
C. Continued Employment
D. getting a good education.&

What Makes a Company Successful? by Elizabeth Franks
****************************************************

We asked fifteen of the most innovative and well-known leaders in business today about what made their companies so successful. They all agreed that a truly competitive and fast-growing company must have the following qualities.
• Leadership: No one person today is smart enough to be in total control of all the parts of a company. The role of today's company leaders is to teach, encourage creativity, and help produce other leaders in each level of an organization.
• Innovation: The ability to invent new products, processes, and possibilities is what innovation is all about. In an economy led by change and speed, every company needs leaders who can motivate workers to be innovative.
• Learning: Competition today means that the knowledge an organization gathers is more important than the number of branch offices it opens. If a company wants to grow quickly, it needs people who can keep learning quickly.
The industry leaders whom we spoke with stressed that it is not only the upper management, but also the employees, who help develop these essential qualities. must work together to build a successful business.

Don't Let Your Computer Send You to the Doctor by Samuel Berger
***************************************************************

Doctors report that the number of computer-related health problems continue to increase. Computer users frequently suffer from finger, hand, forearm, eye, neck, and back problems. Let's discuss a few ways to avoid some of these problems. 
The good news is that there are ways to stop the pain of using a computer. Here are some easy things you can do. Every fifteen to twenty minutes, you should look away from the computer screen. Focus your eyes on something far away for a minute or two. You can also lessen eye stress by closing your eyes and using your fingers to press gently on your eyelids for five seconds. 
To relieve stress in your back and neck, get up and stretch your body. Lift your hands and arms up and reach for the sky! Try to get up and walk around for five minutes every hour. 
If your eyes, neck, or back continue to hurt,  may provide the answer. The field of ergonomics refers to the effect that the design of equipment, like computers or furniture, has on job performance. For example, you can experiment with raising or lowering your chair or moving the computer screen to a higher or lower position to relieve pain. 
These suggestions may not stop all the aches and pain you have, but try them before you call the doctor.


The article discusses how to avoid problems with which of the following parts of the body?
 
 
(A) fingers, head, and legs 
(B) eyes, neck, and back

Eighty-Year-Old Entrepreneur
****************************

Some people believe that senior citizens should retire, enjoy their free time, make baby clothes for their grandchildren, and play mah-jong or checkers in the park. If you're eighty years old, you've certainly earned the right to relax and do nothing. 
Well, don't tell that to Nathaniel Hendersen. This octogenarian has more energy than a team of adolescent soccer players. And he has been in on the ground floor of more than 200 important inventions in the plastics industry. 
What's the secret of his success?
Janice Aldridge, head of Luxury Lifestyles, a customized office furnishings company based in Manhattan, says Hendersen's genius resides in his innovative designs. "Nathaniel is a pioneer in plastics," she reported. "He once told me that he loved imagining solutions to problems and challenges and then making them happen in his design studio."
Hendersen's long-time business partner, Olivier Despuits, would agree. He says Hendersen's contributions to plastics design stem from his unique ability to think outside the box. "Nathaniel is one of the most innovative, creative thinkers I have ever known. His designs for ergonomic keyboards transformed the industry almost overnight."
 
 
K.L. Wong is a venture capitalist who had the foresight to invest millions in Hendersen's ideas. From his corner office on the thirty-second floor, Wong gazes out the window and contemplates the far-reaching impact of Hendersen's inventions. "You asked me what makes Nathaniel so special. Look out there. He has influenced daily life in thousands of offices. Millions of employees are using equipment for which Nathaniel holds the patent." It was Wong who supplied the infusion of seed capital that catapulted Hendersen's designs into the global spotlight.
What does Hendersen himself think? For him, fame and financial success are almost irrelevant. What matters to him is doing what he enjoys. "I love thinking freely!" he exclaims. "My talent is looking at a product that people use on the job and figuring out how to improve it. Fortunately for me," he adds, "that's a talent with wide applicability. And it's fun!"
With his white hair and bristling eyebrows, the diminutive Hendersen is more energetic than many people half his age. Whatever his secret, he is a vital self-starter whose mission in life is to solve problems through innovative designs. You certainly won't find this creative eighty-year-old playing checkers in the park. 

The author of this article probably believes that Nathaniel Hendersen __________.
 
 
(A) should take more time to rest and relax
(B) is proud of his fame and financial success
(C) has not significantly affected office workers
(D) has made a good decision to keep working 



In this article, the word them refers to __________.

(A) solutions
(B) challenges
(C) problems
(D) designs

Memo - Subject: Departmental Restructuring 
******************************************

From: President Hiram Beeker
To: All members of the Department of Information Technology and Management
Subject: Departmental Restructuring 
It is with great regret that I announce the retirement of the department's dean, Dr. Martin Johnston. He has served the department with great distinction for 25 years and we will always remember his vast contributions.
Based on suggestions from department members, we will be restructuring the Department of Information Technology and Management. Dr. Herbert Laveson, currently a senior professor of information management, will assume the post of dean. Dr. Laveson will now oversee the splitting of the department into two major divisions: the education branch, under its new director, Dr. M.S. Ahn; and a new research and development branch, under the internationally known researcher, Dr. C.S. Choudhury, whom we have recruited from the Institute of Technology of Bangalore. Dr. Choudhury's area of expertise is the development of new technological platforms that enable businesses to handle larger amounts of data more efficiently. Aiding businesses in their quest to handle information is an area which we hope will prove to be a lucrative source of funding for our educational mission.
Details of our new department structure are provided in the chart below. For the near future, we will maintain our existing structure in the education branch. In the coming year, however, Dr. Laveson will be soliciting recommendations for departmental evolution that will allow us to meet the challenges of the 21st century. 
Organizational Chart: University of the Cascades
Department of Information Technology and Management
 
According to the memo and organizational chart, which people will be changing positions?
 
(A) Dr. Choudhury, Dr. Ahn, and Dr. Laveson
(B) Dr. Johnston, Dr. Beeker, and Dr. Wang
(C) Dr. Takacs, Dr. Lopez, and Dr. Laveson
(D) Dr. Wang, Dr. Takacs, and Dr. Lopez



Based on the memo and organizational chart, which of the following statements is true?
 
(A) Dr. Choudhury is currently a professor in the department.
(B) A new program has been created in the education branch.
(C) Dr. Laveson is replacing Dr. Johnston as department dean.

Re: My Trip to San Francisco
Number of pages (including this one): 1
Geraldo,As you know,
I am coming to San Francisco on the 21st or 22nd to meet with the sales team. I would rather arrive on the 21st so I can recover from jet lag before the meeting. Would that be possible, given your schedule? If so, please make a reservation for me at any convenient hotel. I don't want to rent a car or take public transportation, so I'd prefer to have a hotel within walking distance of the office. Thanks.
I'd like to prepare you a bit for the meeting itself. I am extremely frustrated with the slow sales so far this year. We need to expand our markets globally in order to increase our profits. This means that we must persuade the sales team to take some initiative and move into new international markets. We can't diversify the product line now, so we have to increase sales for the existing products.
I am relying on you to prepare the sales team for this meeting. The bottom line is that if sales don't turn around, we will have to look into replacing some of the members of our sales team, starting at the top. I don't want to interfere with how you manage your office, but the situation is critical. You must find a way to energize the sales team. We must avoid another quarter of poor sales

Women in the Business World:
A Look into the Life of Helen Sinclair, CEO of Net Graphics
by Ronald Marks

Women hold only 83 of the top jobs in corporate America compared to 2,184 men who have jobs as chairmen, vice chairmen, CEOs, presidents, or executive vice presidents. So what kind of woman makes it to the top?

Meet Helen Sinclair. She is one of the most powerful CEOs in the business world. Ms. Sinclair speaks four languages, was educated at MIT's Sloan School, and just set up a $3 billion stock sale.

Her average weekly schedule is so full, most people would get tired just thinking about . This week, she's on a flight to Rome for lunch with an Italian graphic designer on Monday. On Tuesday, she is in Germany meeting with government officials who want to set up a Web site. By Wednesday, she will be on another plane to meet with a Japanese corporation that markets products on the Internet. If she is lucky, she will get to see her two children on Saturday.

"At first, it was difficult to leave my family so often. And it was also very hard to be a woman in my position. But I stayed positive, and as the company grew more successful, fewer people questioned my ability, as a woman, to do the job."

Sometimes, just sometimes, there is a happy ending!


Look at the word "it" in the article. What or who does the word "it" refer to?
(A) all the graphic designers, government officials and corporate lawyers
(B) Ms. Sinclair's typical job responsibilities from Monday to Friday
(C) the selling price of Net Graphic's stock
(D) Ms. Sinclair's powerful position within the corporation



Why is Ms. Sinclair "lucky" to see her children on the weekend?
(A) She travels a lot.
(B) She balances her work and family life easily.
(C) She gets to fly home every Saturday.
(D) They live in Italy.

To: Mariam de Grange
From: Chris Wang
Subject: Interview for documentary

Hi! I just want to follow up on our plans to interview Jason Carrington for the documentary about craftsmanship. I think we can use some of the ideas below. Let me know what you think.

First of all, he is a very interesting character and my impression is that we could emphasize his distinctive work in the film. He is certainly on the cutting edge of furniture design, and he's also a very charismatic person.

His furniture is sleek and sophisticated. Carrington seems to blend an unconventional approach with respect for Asian and Eastern European heritage in his designs. His skill and imagination flow from a certain nostalgia for the past, but he somehow manages to put a new twist on conventional concepts. He is not so much a revolutionary as a subtle innovator.

According to Carrington's Web site, there has been a dramatic rise in the popularity of his designs. The distribution of the products--especially the living room ensembles and executive office suite furnishings--is primarily in the luxury market, but he caters more to businesses than to individuals buying furniture for their homes. In fact, several multinational companies have commissioned Carrington to design furniture for their major global offices. He says his primary goal is to blend form and function, using locally grown or produced materials to provide a distinctive style that respects the historical heritage of a culture while looking toward its future.

I wouldn't say his furniture has universal appeal--it's too unconventional for some tastes--but he is a pacesetter in the design world. A champagne company recently had Carrington design four sofas to be used in a marketing campaign. He showed me the mock-ups: Each photo features a woman with a champagne glass. The models are dressed in gowns that draw on the style of the couches. The overall impression is one of elegant simplicity.

This guy definitely thinks outside the box. I think his state-of-the art designs will impress our viewers, but I'd like to hear what you think before I schedule another appointment. In the meantime, he's sending us the permission-to-film contract this week. He wanted to have his attorney review the specifics first.


According to this email, furniture designer Jason Carrington displays __________.
	(A) 	a strong commitment to traditional local designs
	(B) 	a blend of traditional and modern elements
	(C) 	universal appeal in the design of his office suites
	(D) 	a totally futuristic design sense in his furniture


In the email above, the word pacesetter means that Carrington __________.
	(A) 	is on the cutting edge of design
	(B) 	is similar to other designers
	(C) 	is unpopular among designers
	(D) 	is commercially successful

Tip Selects Chadwick and Sons

Tip of New York, the five-star restaurant owned by the Atlantic Gold Corporation, announced yesterday that Chadwick and Sons of New York, a division of the GlobeCom Group, is taking over the creative side of its branding initiatives.

The Tip account had been handled by Reveres in Los Angeles, part of the Capades Group.

Tip's costs in this deal are thought to be close to US$500,000.

Tip considered four firms during a lengthy review that became quite competitive, according to Matthew St. Michael, Public Relations Director at Tip. Potential agencies included Reveres; Bell, Bond & Bar of New York; and Gold, Choi & Partners of London, part of the Gold Choi Creative Outlet division of TNT Partners.

"Our primary goal is to work toward reestablishing consistency in Tip's local and national branding," said Galina Felton, Vice President of Public Relations and Branding at Chadwick and Sons. "Tip is an icon of purity in the preparation

and presentation of fine foods. We will capitalize on that to reinforce their image of quality, excellent service, and luxury."

Ms. Chadwick said that clientele should remember eating at Tip as a "healthful and seductive experience. The new branding campaign will accomplish that goal," she said.

Chadwick and Sons holds accounts with more than 20 major restaurants in the New England and Mid-Atlantic regions.

Tip opened in 1967 and was owned privately by Chef Remi St. Jean until 1987, when it was sold to the Atlantic Gold Corporation for US$2.7 million. Rumors have circulated for years that Atlantic Gold intended to open new Tip restaurants in several major U.S. cities. The move to Chadwick and Sons is seen by some restaurant industry insiders as an obvious first step in that direction.


According to the article, Chadwick and Sons will __________.
	(A) 	make the most of Tip's wealthy customers
	(B) 	seduce Tip customers with creative pricing
	(C) 	try to create the same image of Tip everywhere
	(D) 	help Tip improve its food presentation practices

In the article, that refers to __________.
	(A) 	Tip's local and national branding
	(B) 	an impression of a lifestyle of luxury
	(C) 	reestablishing local branding consistency
	(D) 	being a symbol of purity in food service

Ms. Lily Kwan
Animation Plus Studios
10 Downtown Plaza
M6B 2B3 Toronto
Canada

Dear Ms. Kwan,

Thank you very much for sending us your sketches. Our design team felt that your two main cartoon characters would be compatible with our marketing approach. In particular, the character of the witty skunk as the intelligent partner of the teenage superhero was immensely appealing. We think we can use the concept of their partnership in the advertising campaign for our new line of athletic shoes.

We would like to meet with you as soon as possible to see if we can set something in motion for the coming fiscal year. We think we could incorporate the skunk as a symbol of independence. His personality is very charismatic and we could pitch him as the visual image associated with the product line. In our assessment, the friendship between the skunk and the teenager is an incredibly powerful image that will appeal to the adolescent and pre-teen markets. The skunk's humorous attitude is a great complement to the teenage hero's seriousness.

I would appreciate it if you could come to London this month and stay for two or three days. Would that be feasible? Our design team can meet with you either Thursday and Friday, the fourteenth and fifteenth, or Monday and Tuesday, the eighteenth and nineteenth. We would, of course, cover all your expenses and pay your stated consulting fee. Your accommodations would be at Hotel Excelsior, which is a pleasant jaunt from our headquarters.

Please let me know whether you will be able to join us on the dates I have proposed. We are very enthusiastic about our innovative line and are delighted to be working with you.

Sincerely yours,

J.P. Petrakis
Product Development Unit

When Do You Need a Consultant?

Many companies hire consultants for short-term projects. But when is it advantageous and cost-effective to do so? There are four situations when you should consider using a consultant.

First, if specific expertise is lacking in your own staff, hiring a consultant can help. Bringing someone in for a short time may be better than hiring new employees. It depends on the type of knowledge or skills you need, as well as the nature and length of the project.

Second, if your company's market or industry has changed, someone with a broad perspective can help you adjust to altered circumstances. In this case, it is good to bring in a consultant with wide knowledge of your industry.

Third, if there is disagreement within your team, an experienced consultant can sometimes help untangle problems. Staff members who seem stubborn or unreasonable with their colleagues may be open to new ideas from an outside expert.

Fourth, if your firm is facing a temporarily increased workload, consider using a consultant to manage that work. A consultant can keep you from having to pull key managers away from their own jobs to handle the new projects.

If you do choose to pursue the option of hiring a consultant, however, keep in mind that you'll get a better result if you clearly define your objectives ahead of time. What is it you want this person to do? If you are not clear about this at the outset, you run the risk of wasting time and money. You may also offend your own employees if they feel they could have done the job better than the consultant.


The author of this article believes that hiring a consultant is __________.
	(A) 	almost always quite cost-effective
	(B) 	rarely advantageous for companies
	(C) 	worthwhile under some circumstances
	(D) 	often not very cost-effective

In the article, what does the word this refer to?
	(A) 	hiring a consultant
	(B) 	a much better result
	(C) 	wasting time and money
	(D) 	what your objectives are

Annual Sales Report

We had an excellent year at Dymo Industries. Total sales were US$550 million. This is an impressive growth of 10% compared to last year.

There are a few important reasons for the large increase in sales. All the international divisions performed very well. The new sales training helped many of us promote our new line of toys. In addition, the creation of new products opened more markets for us.

We continued last year to provide our customers with improved products. We all know that product enhancement can lead to larger market shares. Therefore, we hope to continue increasing our sales by creating better products in the coming year.

I am pleased to end this report with further good news. Because of our dramatic rise in sales, employees will be receiving a yearly bonus of twice the amount given last year.

Congratulations on your great teamwork! We look forward to reporting on another successful year this time next year

How much time do you spend on business activities after work or on the weekend? Do you take time to relax and have fun? A recent survey of 200 American managers revealed how most of them spend their free time. The survey results are based on the number of managers that listed each activity.

The managers were asked to list the kinds of business and leisure activities that they did at least once a week after work or on the weekend. The most common business activity (50%) was working on a computer at home. This was followed by going to dinner with business contacts (24%), telephoning business contacts (15%), and working on a job report (14%). A full 5 percent of managers didn't work at home in their free time.

On the other hand, a large percentage of these managers also took time for some . The survey revealed that over half (59%) listed spending time with friends and family as their leisure activity. Other leisure activities included reading books for fun (41%), listening to music (41%), and playing sports (30%).

The good news is that a large percentage of the managers spend their time doing leisure activities. While managers have traditionally taken their work home with them, the results of the survey indicate that this trend may be changing. Life for the average manager is no longer all work and no play.

Mr. Lee will be arriving tomorrow at 7:45 a.m. on Asia Airlines. We have arranged for him to be picked up and driven to our office. He should get here around 8:30 a.m. or a little later. I will greet him when he arrives at the office.

We want him to have a tour of our production . Would you mind being the one to show him around? It should only take thirty minutes for this introductory tour.

After a short meeting with Mr. Turner, the Vice President of Production, we would like to take Mr. Lee out for a very nice lunch. I was thinking of the Italian restaurant, Primo. Would you mind making a lunch reservation for five people at 1 p.m. tomorrow at this restaurant?

Call me if there is any problem with the reservation.

Thanks for your help,

Failure Can Make You Stronger: A Look Into the Life of Peter Hill

By Joyce Robinson

Peter Hill is one of the most talked about men in Silicon Valley. However, he was not always so successful. Hill lost so much money in 1975 on his first business that he had to sell it. It was the only way to stop the bank from taking away his home.

Today he is the vice president of Micronex, one of the world's semiconductor superpowers. In fact, Micronex just exceeded revenue estimates for the third quarter by 12 percent when all the other semiconductor businesses in the Valley saw a decrease in revenues.

"Although I lost my first business, I learned a great deal about management, cash flow, and how to talk to bankers," he recalls, with a smile. "But what I really learned was how to do things better."
		
Hill admits that in the beginning, his management style was difficult for some members of his team at Micronex. "I believe in confrontation--getting in each other's faces, disagreeing a little. It's a powerful tool if it doesn't get too personal and if it has a goal."

However, more than anything else, Hill believes in innovation. He encourages his employees to dream up new ways to do things every day. But he warns that innovation can't be scheduled like a meeting. "Sometimes I just don't have any idea how to approach a particular issue. Then suddenly, at 3:00 in the morning, I wake up shouting, 'I've got it! I know what to do.'"

Which example does the writer use to indicate how successful Peter Hill's company is?
	(A) 	Mr. Hill didn't have to borrow money from the bank
	(B) 	Micronex increased revenues in the third quarter, but other companies didn't.
	(C) 	Mr. Hill sold his business for a 12 percent profit.
	(D) 	Micronex had higher revenues during the first three quarters of the year.

Look at the word in the newspaper article. What or who does refer to?
	(A) 	innovations that are created by employees
	(B) 	employees at Micronex
	(C) 	new ways to do things that Mr. Hill dreams up
	(D) 	scheduled meetings

Know What You’re Worth

Brent Snodgrass

Money. When you're looking for a job, that's what you want. Nevertheless, these days--I'm sorry to say--money doesn't grow on corporate trees. You can't clamber up the corporate ladder with the attitude that each new employer is going to tack on 10% to your existing salary.

This means that, unless you can capitalize on your number-one product--yourself--you're out of luck.

Wake up and smell the coffee! You're going to have to do some serious negotiating, and that takes some know-how.

"Salaries have been on a roller-coaster ride," acknowledged Abu Baquir, CEO at Martinson and Shrift Management Consultants. "It's very difficult to predict what a complete compensation package will include these days."

Job candidates can find out what they're worth by investigating, Baquir added. "The strategy is to find the salaries of your high-profile peers right on the Internet." There are several easily accessible Web sites that have sophisticated search engines. You type in your job title or description and your region. The Web site will give you a range of possible salaries. If you know people in your industry, you can also talk with them. They may be able to set up informational interviews with people who can tell you what to expect if you change jobs. The key is to do your research before you begin looking.

Once you've discovered what you're worth, it's time to start looking at job postings. Remember, though you want to be properly compensated, an enormous salary may not be the only alternative. Stop to think about the different compensation packages you might accept and what a company might be willing to offer.

One angle to consider is supplementing your expected salary with cash, stocks, or bonuses, according to Sara Greenwald, a career architect at JobBuild Magazine.

"Go into the salary negotiation expecting to adjust the equation and present alternate scenarios," Greenwald suggested. "For example, ask for 40% in salary and 60% in stocks and bonuses that will be based on your performance. Make the pitch that you'll show them what you're made of before they have to pay you."

According to the article, employees who are considering moving to a new company should __________.
	(A) 	compare companies and choose the one that offers the highest salary
	(B) 	research compensation ranges for their job in a variety of companies
	(C) 	think about compensation that is based solely on their job performance
	(D) 	expect to make 10% more money when they start a new position



At the beginning of the article, the word this refers to __________.
	(A) 	less money available for salaries in corporations
	(B) 	what compensation you want as a job candidate
	(C) 	trying to find a new and better job these days
	(D) 	taking advantage of your number-one product

Pages including this one: 1

Thank you for your fax of April 29.

Here is my new flight arrival information: AL #603 at SFO Airport on May 15 at 9 a.m. I wanted to arrive an hour earlier, but there were no direct flights from Boston to San Francisco at that time. The only reservations I could get at an earlier time required a 2-hour layover in Chicago. I didn't want to waste time waiting at the Chicago airport. Could you please arrange for me to pick up a rental car at the airport in San Francisco?

Also, please change the 10 a.m. tour time to 11 a.m. because of my later flight time. Thank you for making these changes to the schedule.

Joseph Kolb, our Production Manager, will be coming with me. I would like him to take a company tour with us. The tour should not last more than an hour because we have a 12:00 noon lunch meeting.

See you on the 15th.

Kind regards,

Ms. Natasha Gold

Test
==========


When I travel on business, I don't want to waste time deciding what to eat, where to eat, or how to get to a restaurant. The best idea is to ask about places to eat before you leave on your trip. Find out if friends, family, and co-workers know of any good restaurants in the city where you will be staying. Write down the names, addresses, and phone numbers of any restaurants that are recommended to you. Be sure to put this list in your wallet or purse so it's easy to find. 

If you can't get any helpful  before you go, you can always ask for advice at the hotel where you are staying. The person you should talk to for suggestions is usually called the concierge. The concierge's job is to help guests make restaurant reservations, get tickets to theater or music events for them, or to suggest places for them to shop. 

Talk to the concierge as early as you can. Tell the concierge what kind of food you want (I always ask for a good Italian restaurant, as most cities seem to have one). In addition, tell the concierge what time you want to eat, how far you want to travel, and how much money you want to spend. This is a very fast and easy way to find good restaurants if you didn't get recommendations before leaving home. 

Good luck and happy eating!

Re: Notes from March 23 meeting
DATE: March 24 

Thank you for meeting with me yesterday. This memo documents our discussion and our ideas for addressing the company's current situation.

In the long run, we must be flexible in order to deal with the problems our company faces. But more immediately, we should show the CEO that we can work with reduced staff to achieve our goals.

We have a great opportunity to produce a fine product even though the number of employees on our assembly line has been reduced. As we agreed yesterday, we want to increase our global reach while boosting our ability to provide our products locally. This is a key balance that we must continue to pursue. 

We also agreed to meet again on Tuesday of next week to discuss additional strategies for achieving these goals. When our two departments have discussed our ideas, we can schedule a meeting with the executive team to present our suggestions.

As you pointed out yesterday, we have experienced some significant layoffs as a result of the recent merger. Like you, I'm concerned that the remaining employees may feel overwhelmed because of their increased workloads. But I know I can count on you and your team to implement the new strategies for expanding our sales. I am optimistic about the future of our company. I am sure that, working together, we can come to a consensus about the next steps we should take.



 Kim Sanders has written to Angel Simon to __________. 
 
 (A)  tell Angel exactly what to do next in the assembly line 
 (B)  express disapproval of Angel's ideas about the company

 (D)  summarize the ideas that they discussed yesterday

As members of the marketing department, we have been given the task of writing the new company brochure. The purpose of this brochure is to appeal to potential employees. The brochure should present this company as a great place to work. 
I think we should begin by listing all of the most attractive qualities of our company. We shouldn't be considering just the basic qualities, like good benefits and competitive salaries. Many other companies have these qualities; we need something that makes us unique or different from them. 

However, we must limit the list, since we can't include everything. Therefore, I've asked the human resources department to assist us by giving us a list of the few truly unique characteristics that they think the brochure ought to stress. 

After doing some brainstorming myself, I've come up with the following characteristics: job security, stock options for employees, physical fitness centers on site, and open communication. Do a little  yourself, and after thinking about all the appealing qualities of our company, please email a limited list to me. 

See you at the meeting this afternoon, 

Arthur

How will the human resources department help? 
 
 (A)  by producing a brochure that appeals to all companies 
 (B)  by helping to characterize the basic qualities

 There are many books available about job interviews, but unfortunately, there's very little time to read them. To make your busy life easier, here is a quick list of essential points. Keep  in mind next time you have a job interview in the United States. 
Be clear on what you want to ask about the company and the job. 
Plan to talk half the time and let the employer talk the other half of the time (or more). 
Keep each answer to two minutes or less. Don't talk on and on. 
Never say anything negative about a previous employer or previous place where you worked. 
Take any evidence, such as a portfolio, you have of past accomplishments to show your potential employer. The artist's portfolio, for example, would include a collection of samples of his or her best artwork. Computer programmers would have printouts of programs they have written. 
Always write a thank-you note the same day as the interview, and send it to the employer. 
Remember that the person who gets the job is not always the one who has the best qualifications. The person who gets hired is often the one who knows the most about interviewing well.

Why should someone read this article? 
 
 (A)  People who are prepared for interviews frequently get jobs. 
 (B)  It explains the two-minute employer response. 
 (C)  It makes a person's job qualifications clearer. 
 (D)  Interviewers will also read this article. 
 
Look at the word  in the memo. What does the word  refer to? 
 
 (A)  the books available on the market for interviewing techniques 
 (B)  helpful tips when speaking to potential employers 
 (C)  the people who conduct the interview 
 (D)  a portfolio of work done when going for an interview

Next month, the Geo Tech Mining Inc. headquarters will relocate to the Paris office. Two thirds of our business is in Europe now, and a full third of this European business is in France. Therefore, it is more convenient to have our main office where a majority of our clients will be able to meet with us much more easily.

However, I know that many New York employees do not want to move to Paris. When we move to Paris, some people will probably quit and look for other jobs.

I don't want to lose our employees, but it is too expensive to keep both locations open. Do you have any ideas about what we could offer to our staff so that they won't ? I really don't want them to leave the company. We want our best people on board when we move.

Thank you for your help with this serious problem. I hope to hear from you as soon as possible.

Best regards,

Daniel Ferrier

Today the economy is stronger than it has been for several years and there are many job opportunities in the labor market. It is not surprising then that workers' expectations and requirements are high as they search for the perfect job. The position, salary, and conditions of a job must meet the workers' .

In a recent survey commissioned by the Labor Department, fifty thousand employees throughout the country were asked to rank the desirability of 250 jobs in today's market. The criteria used to rank these jobs were environment, income, security, stress, and physical demands.

Four of the five top-ranked jobs were connected to the high-tech industry, namely Web site manager, computer systems analyst, software engineer, and computer programmer. Meanwhile, jobs involving difficult working conditions, like long hours, heavy lifting, or an element of danger, were ranked toward the bottom of the list; the bottom five were taxi-driver, dancer, cowboy, construction worker, and fisherman.

Some critics argue that other criteria should have been included in this list. However, the results of the survey indicate that more and more people see jobs related to computers and the Internet as the way to go in their employment search.
 

The article says that __________.

	(A) 	people are interested only in computer- and Internet-related jobs

RE:Selection of HR Director

As you know, we need to choose potential candidates for the position of Human Resource Director at the WorldSpeak Spain office. Because you have many contacts in the local business community, I would like you to be the one responsible for recruiting. As you are looking for possible personnel to interview and hire, please feel free to spend the money you need for local job advertisements in the industry newspapers or magazines.

Do you think it would be a smart move to post the job position on the Internet? Here in New York, we have found this to be a productive and fast way to recruit talented people. It is especially convenient to receive and read resumes using the Internet. I don't know whether or not this would work in Spain.

Finally, remember that we really want to hire someone who has excellent English-language skills. The Human Resource Director you hire will need to communicate and work with headquarters daily, so the ability to speak English well and to write various letters and reports is very important.

Good luck with the job search. I will contact you within the week.

Which reason below is NOT suggested by Mr. Johnson as a good reason to use the Internet?
(A) Using the Internet works well in Spain.

Two years ago, my uncle Frank was the kind of person who never slowed down. At work or at play, he always pushed himself harder than anyone else. People say that he didn't know how to relax. He always got very impatient when he had to stand in line at a bank or a movie theater because he didn't like to waste time. When he was young, he was great at sports, not because he was a natural athlete but because he was so competitive. He simply hated losing! As an adult, he had the same aggressive attitude about his career. He became a highly successful lawyer through hard work and long hours. Then suddenly, at the age of 43, Uncle Frank had a heart attack. That was when I learned how dangerous a stress-related disease could be.

Everyone experiences stress. Stressful experiences are impossible to avoid. However, different people respond to stress in different ways. Most doctors say that you can reduce the harmful effects of stress by doing the following things:
•	get regular exercise
•	eat good food
•	get plenty of sleep
•	give yourself time to relax

Uncle Frank did none of these things. He was always at his desk, working. Because he was so busy, he usually didn't eat well or missed meals completely. He took work home with him and often worked until late at night. As a result, he couldn't control the effects of stress in his life.

Thanks to Uncle Frank, I learned that reducing stress might be "the key" to living longer and avoiding many kinds of illness. Now I know how to control the bad effects of stress. I follow my doctor's advice by eating right, sleeping well, and exercising at least three times a week. Uncle Frank has learned this lesson too. Now we exercise together once a week.

Look at the phrase "the key" in the article. Which phrase below means the same thing as the key?
(A) a tool used to open a door
(B) the best way
(C) something that causes stress
(D) a very competitive person
My answer is B

What is the lesson that the writer learned about stress?

As announced last week, the first quarter revenues for BoostQuik did not meet expectations. However, even though the initial reactions of consumers have not been as positive as we might have wished, we will soon be able to capitalize on the endorsement of our energy/vitamin drink by three up-and-coming athletes--a female tennis player, a male cyclist, and a male soccer star--who will be featured in our advertising. (Note: Their names cannot be released until contract negotiations have been officially concluded.)

The tennis player is particularly charismatic and well-respected in our target market. Although the older-adult market is saturated with diet supplements, this campaign should enable us to reach a vast younger audience using her distinctive image. Her value as a status symbol has increased because of her success in several international competitions over the past year.

Several recent inquiries and orders from wholesale distributors suggest that second-quarter sales will be stronger. We should try to maintain that momentum through the third quarter, using television advertisements at major sporting events. The fitness industry is both booming and highly competitive at this time, so we must brainstorm some creative approaches for growing market share.

The marketing team brainstormed several strategies this morning and came up with four recommendations:

All three athletes should wear our company logo on their clothing and consume BoostQuik publicly at sporting events.
The athletes' life stories and latest accomplishments should be featured on our Web site.
The athletes' pictures should be prominently displayed on all our packaging.
We should take out full-page ads in the leading tennis, soccer, and cycling magazines. Highlighting the benefits of BoostQuik for these particular sports enthusiasts should help us gain wider name recognition.
Our primary marketing goal is to raise the visibility of BoostQuik in the fitness industry. For this reason, we suggest adding a fourth athlete, possibly a female gymnast, to our group of celebrity endorsements. We should hold off on selecting a gymnast, however, until after the annual world competition this summer. This will allow us to select a young athlete with star appeal. For the long term, it would also be very helpful if BoostQuik could become an official sponsor of the Olympic Games. Implementation of this marketing strategy will greatly raise our profile in the energy/vitamin drink market and will lead to increased sales later this year.
